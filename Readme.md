This NonogramSolver builds upon FD.js by Srikumar K. S. <srikumarks@gmail.com>,
which can be found on GitHub at https://github.com/srikumarks/FD.js.

The algorithm behind the solver makes use of a regular constraint as described
in the paper "Regular Language Membership Constraint" by Niko Paltzer.
